## 1. Access modifiers
>There are four types of Java access modifiers:
><p><b>Private:</b> The access level of a private modifier is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from outside the class.</p>
><p><b>Default:</b> The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. It cannot be accessed from outside the package. If you do not specify any access level, it will be the default.</p>
><p><b>Protected:</b> The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class. If you do not make the child class, it cannot be accessed from outside the package.</p>
><p><b>Public:</b> The access level of a public modifier is everywhere. It can be accessed from within the class, outside the class, within the package and outside the package.</p>

## 2. Difference between Constructor and Destructor

## Depend upon the language there are 3 type of Constructor are there 
>Default Constructor ( Also know as non-parametrized Constructor )<br/>
>Parametrized Constructor<br/>
>Copy Constructor

## Overloading
><p>Overloading refers to the ability to define multiple methods or functions with the same name but with different parameters. This allows the same name to be used to perform different operations based on the arguments passed to it.</p>
><p>Overloading can be done with methods in classes or with functions in a module. When a method or function is overloaded, the compiler or interpreter is able to determine which version of the method or function to call based on the number, type, and order of the arguments passed to it.</p>
><p>For example, a class might have multiple constructors with the same name but different arguments. When an object is created using the class, the constructor with the appropriate arguments is called based on what is passed.</p>
><p>Overloading is a powerful feature of object-oriented programming that allows developers to write code that is more expressive, easier to read and understand, and more flexible.</p>
